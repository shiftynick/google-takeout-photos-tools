# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project welcomes issues, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Getting started

- Ensure you have Python 3.10+
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Reporting bugs

- Search existing issues before opening a new one
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, OS/Python versions, and logs/tracebacks

## Proposing features

- Open a feature request issue describing the use case and value
- Keep scope small where possible

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch off `main`
2. Make changes with clear, readable code and helpful commit messages
3. Run linters/formatters if configured and ensure your changes pass
4. Update docs/examples where relevant
5. Open a pull request with a concise description and link any related issues

## Code style

- Prefer explicit, readable names over abbreviations
- Add docstrings for public functions and complex logic
- Handle errors thoughtfully and avoid deep nesting
